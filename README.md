## User Experience
### Initial Discussion
The purpose of the web application is offer users with medium to large sized gardens a way to preview or prepare for the planting of vegetable crops in a way that best utilises space for maximum harvest yield.

### User Stories
#### First-time Visitor Goals
* To understand the purpose of the web application.
* To interact with the input fields without confusion as to their purpose.
* To customise the outputs for their specific needs.
#### Returning Visitor Goals
* To be able to reproduce previous results
* To reference specific planting information for certain vegetables.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
A colour scheme was chosen to reflect tones seen in the garden and the make the user feel excited about working with the earth under a clear blue sky.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created for this website for mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes. The original idea was a set of four interactive areas for the user to supply information about their garden and preferred vegetables, and for the application to provide guidance on planting of bulbs. The concept was simplified after a discussion with my CI Mentor and revised to deal with one type of vegetable at a time.

Custom input field validation was written in order to avoid the submit button refreshing the page as preventDefault didn't work fully as expected.

The recalculate button does not clear the input fields as the user may wish to simply change the vegetable, not the size of the vegetable bed.

to-do: Make a function to replace the switch.
